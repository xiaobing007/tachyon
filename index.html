<h2>Tachyon</h2>

<p>Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed ﬁle system enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce.It offers up to 300 times higher throughput than HDFS, by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively.

Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going to disk to load datasets that is frequently read.

</p>

    <p>We released
      <a href="https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Tachyon-Release-0.2.0">Tachyon 0.2.0</a> on April 10th, 2013.
      The new version is much more stable and also features significant performance improvements.
    </p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Building-Tachyon-from-Source-Code">quick start tutorial</a> to get Tachyon running locally in a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Features of v0.2.0</h2>

<h3>Java-like File API</h3>

<p>Tachyon has an API similar to JAVA file, providing <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html">InputStream</a>, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html">OutputStream</a> interface, and efficient support for memory mapped I/O.</p>

<h3>Generic Filesystem Interface</h3>

<p>Tachyon v0.2.0 introduces a simple interface that allows for clean and easy compatibility with an underlying filesystem. Native support for both HDFS and a single node local filesystem is included in this release.</p>

<h3>Improved Utilities</h3>

<p>A web interface and command line support are included in the v0.2.0 release. The web interface allows users to easily monitor the status of their cluster and see information such as which files are cached. Command line operations such as creating/deleting folders and copying from and to local are also available.</p>

<h3>Simple Deployment</h3>

<p>The deployment process for Tachyon is now much more straight forward. You can get a local cluster running in just a few minutes!</p>
